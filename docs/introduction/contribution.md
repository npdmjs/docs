# Contribution

NP(D)M is developed as an experimental open source project. I would appreciate any comments, questions, support and contribution. I see a huge potential in the concept and would like to keep the project alive. There is a list of the features, far from complete, which could be implemented in scope of the NPDM project:

- Deployment (and versioning) of the host application through the NPDM server
- Preparing production-ready boilerplates for host applications and remotes for different frameworks
- Different validations, including validation of major versions change in runtime
- Feature toggles solution for the convenient modules versioning management in runtime
- Dynamic modules compatibility tracking and management
- And many many others!

Let's keep in touch in:
